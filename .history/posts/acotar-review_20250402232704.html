            <div class="post-content">
                <p>Sarah J. Maas's "A Court of Thorns and Roses" has taken the book world by storm, but does it deserve the hype? In my opinion: not quite.</p>
                
                <h2>Problematic Romance</h2>
                <p>The central relationship between Feyre and Tamlin starts with concerning power dynamics that are never properly addressed. What's framed as passionate often crosses into controlling behavior that left me uncomfortable.</p>
                
                <h2>Worldbuilding Issues</h2>
                <p>While the faerie courts present an interesting premise, the rules of magic and politics feel inconsistent. Important elements seem to change based on what the plot requires in the moment.</p>
                
                <h2>Bright Spots</h2>
                <p>I will acknowledge Maas's ability to write action sequences, and some secondary characters (particularly Lucien) show glimmers of depth that made me wish they had more page time.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Final Rating:</strong> 2.5/5 - An okay fantasy romance but fails to live up to its reputation.</p>
