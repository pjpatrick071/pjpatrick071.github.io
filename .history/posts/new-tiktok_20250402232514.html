                <p>Big changes are coming to my TikTok channel next month!</p>
                
                <h2>What's New</h2>
                <p>Starting April 1st, I'll be launching a weekly series called "60-Second Reviews" where I break down books in short, digestible videos. The twist? Each review will incorporate a different trending audio or format.</p>
                
                <h2>Schedule</h2>
                <p>New videos will drop every Tuesday and Friday at 5pm EST. The first month will focus on fantasy novels, with subsequent months exploring different genres based on audience polls.</p>
                
                <h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
                <p>I'll also be sharing occasional "Bookstagram vs. Reality" clips showing my messy writing process and the chaotic reality behind curated book photos.</p>
