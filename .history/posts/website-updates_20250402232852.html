                <p>PJ's Postings is getting a makeover! Here's what to expect in the coming weeks:</p>
                
                <h2>New Features</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Dark mode option for night readers</li>
                    <li>Improved search functionality</li>
                    <li>Book review rating system (with content warnings)</li>
                    <li>Dedicated author interview section</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h2>Design Changes</h2>
                <p>The overall layout will remain familiar but with better spacing, more readable fonts, and a more cohesive color scheme. I'm particularly excited about the new custom illustrations being created!</p>
                
                <h2>Timeline</h2>
                <p>The update will roll out in phases starting April 15th, with the full transition complete by May 1st. Some pages might look odd during the transition - bear with me!</p>
